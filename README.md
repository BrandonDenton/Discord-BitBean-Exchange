# Discord-BitBean-Exchange

Discord is a fun place where tens of thousands of people gather to play and socialize. Wouldn't be cool if you could easily trade the hottest new cryptocurrency through it as well? With a bot running BitBean Exchange, you can!

## Setup

You don't need much to get a BitBean slingin' bot up and running, but the process still requires a few steps that I'll list below.

### Dependencies

* JavaScript - latest stable version
* NPM - package manager for JavaScript
* Winston - JavaScript logging library, more info [here](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston)
* discord.js - the meat and potatoes of the whole bot
